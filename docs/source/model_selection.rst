Model Selection
===============

In this section, we find 3 functions to support you in selecting your model.

- Split the data in train and test set.
- Create out of fold prediction on the entire dataset while getting insights on what your model is using to get to such predictions
- Perform a grid search on your model or pipeline. You can also test if what processing of the data (or what new features) are getting you to better results
