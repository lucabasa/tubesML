    It assures that if some column is missing or is new after the first transform, the pipeline won't break
    
    To avoid problems with using both ``drop_first`` and ``match_cols``, specifically if the dropped category is
    missing when dummies are created after the first time, we let ``match_cols`` to have the role of ``drop_first``
    if the transformer has been ran already. See test_match_columns_drop_first_equal for an example.
    
    The fit method simply passes the data as in the ``BaseTransformer``
    
        
    :param drop_first: bool, default False.
                If True, the first dummy column is dropped

    :param match_col: bool, default False.
                If True, it makes sure that all the columns found calling the transformer the first time are found 
                every other time the transform method is called. It thus adds the missing columns (with all 0 values)
                and removes the columns not previously found.

    :param verbose: bool, default False.
             If True, it raises a UserWarning when the ``_match_columns`` method is invoked
